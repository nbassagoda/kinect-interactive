# Kinect Interactive
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for coding within the context of the visual arts. Taking advantage of this feature and making use of the depth map provided by a kinect we can make some awesome visuals controlling them with our movement. In this project you can find some examples of this.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites
Before you run the app make sure you have the following installed:
 - Processing 3.0 or up. 

- Kinect v1

- SimpleOpenNI Library

To add this last library do the following once you open Processing:

- Go to the menu: Sketch-> Import Library...-> Add Library... 

- Select and install SimpleOpenNI

### Running

- First clone the repo, go to the folder and open the file `kinect_interactive.pde`

- Once you're running the Processing Development Environment (or PDE), make sure to connect and turned on the kinect. To run the project just click the play button located across the top, in the toolbar. 

- By now, the project should be up and running. In order for the kinnect to track your body just perform a wave gesture with your hand. Once the kinect successfully detected your hand just move it in order to interact with the visuals 

- To change scene just type a number from 1 to 7 with the keyboard and the corresponding scene will pop up in the screen


> **NOTE:** The kinect software did not work as desired in Windows or Linux. For this matters it is recommended to run it in Mac OS.
